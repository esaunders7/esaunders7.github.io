			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>My name is Emma Saunders, and I am 21 years old. I attend the University of South Carolina in Columbia, but I was born in Savannah, Georgia. I am one of three siblings and the oldest. When I was younger, I enjoyed playing every sport including soccer, basketball, cheerleading, swimming, and running. However it was not until the end of middle school that I got introduced to the sport of golf. This game taught me patience, time-management, and intelligence which I have taken with me to this university.</p>
			<p id="first" class="hidden">My favorite activities to do in my spare time include playing golf with my family, spending time with my friends, boating, traveling, and reading. I also love sports and watch games or matches whenever I can. One of my other favorite hobies includes listening to music. I like a large variety and always try to find a cheap, live band to see or travel to concerts. My favorite one so far has been either Whiskey Myers or Post Malone. I hope to travel and see more bands/artists in the near future.</p>

			<h3>My Future Career Plans</h3>
			<p>After I finish my undergraduate degree I plan on attending graduate school. I am hoping that this includes medical or physician assistant school. After this, I will enter into a career at a hospital near either Savannah, Georgia or Charleston, South Carolina. My dream would be to work as either a heart surgeon's assistant or as an endodontist in a smaller office. These jobs are very different but each contain different aspects of what I want. One is a high pressure, exciting job while the other has a nice work, life balance. I am hoping graduate school helps me narrow down my interests.</p>
			<p id="second" class="hidden">I have always known that I wanted to work in the medical field. I have a passion for helping people, especially kids, so when I was younger I thought I wanted to go into neonatology or pediatric surgery. I have spent the last two years shadowing and interviewing people in my potential career fields and know that these jobs are more demanding than I want my life to be. Besides working, I want to have a big family and need a job that has a manageable work/life balance.</p>
